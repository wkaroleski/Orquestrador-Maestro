# Project DEV Hierarchy

`DEV/` is the canonical project documentation and operational memory root.

Use it to reduce token use across sessions: read compact control files first, then load only the task-relevant detail files.

## Required Files

Every project that uses this convention should keep:

- `DEV/README.md`: short project documentation entrypoint.
- `DEV/INDEX.md`: map of available project docs and what each file is for.
- `DEV/HANDOFF.md`: compact current snapshot for the next AI or human.
- `DEV/CONTEXT.md`: current project state, constraints, commands, and risks.
- `DEV/SPECS/ACTIVE.md`: active goal, scope, acceptance, and verification plan.
- `DEV/WORKLOG.md`: compact chronological hook of substantive work.
- `DEV/VERIFY.md`: latest verification evidence and outcomes.

## Recommended Sub-Hierarchy

Use these paths when relevant:

- `DEV/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `DEV/DECISIONS.md`
- `DEV/ADR/`
- `DEV/API/`
- `DEV/DATABASE/`
- `DEV/TESTING.md`
- `DEV/RUNBOOKS/`
- `DEV/TASKS/`
- `DEV/ROADMAP.md`
- `DEV/RESEARCH/`
- `DEV/HANDOFFS/`
- `DEV/HANDOFFS/WORKLOG_ARCHIVE.md`

## Compatible Existing Sub-Hierarchies

Many projects already use a richer DEV tree. Treat these as first-class compatible paths:

- `DEV/LOGS/`
- `DEV/SQL/`
- `DEV/ARCH/`
- `DEV/WORKFLOWS/`
- `DEV/TESTS/`
- `DEV/DOCUMENTATION/`
- `DEV/BACKLOG/`

Do not rename or move existing DEV docs just to match the recommended names. Add or update `DEV/INDEX.md` so agents can map the current project layout quickly.

## Read Order

When entering a project:

1. Read the nearest project `AGENTS.md`, when present.
2. Read `DEV/README.md` or `DEV/INDEX.md`.
3. Read `DEV/HANDOFF.md`.
4. Read `DEV/CONTEXT.md`.
5. Read `DEV/SPECS/ACTIVE.md`.
6. Open only the detail files relevant to the task.
7. Open `DEV/WORKLOG.md` only when the handoff or spec is not enough.
8. Select global skills after project context is understood.

Do not bulk-load the full `DEV/` tree by default.

## Write Hook

After any substantive project work, update:

- `DEV/WORKLOG.md` with one compact entry.
- `DEV/VERIFY.md` with the latest checks.
- `DEV/HANDOFF.md` with the next-session snapshot.
- `DEV/SPECS/ACTIVE.md` when scope, acceptance, or status changes.

Each worklog entry should stay small:

```text
## YYYY-MM-DD - Short task title

- Spec: `DEV/SPECS/ACTIVE.md` or equivalent task doc
- Changed: paths or areas touched
- Why: one sentence
- Verified: command or manual check
- Risks: only active risks
- Next context: only what the next AI needs
```

Also update:

- `DEV/INDEX.md` when a DEV doc is created, renamed, or removed.
- `DEV/CONTEXT.md` when project assumptions, commands, architecture, environment, or risks change.
- The relevant detail file when a durable decision or project fact changes.

## Worklog Control

`DEV/WORKLOG.md` should not become a long transcript.

Use the helpers below:

- `orquestrador-maestro compact-worklog --project-path <project> --keep 12`
- `orquestrador-maestro check-dev-gates --project-path <project> --max-entries 12 --strict`

`compact-worklog` keeps only the most recent entries in `DEV/WORKLOG.md`, archives older entries into `DEV/HANDOFFS/WORKLOG_ARCHIVE.md`, and refreshes `DEV/HANDOFF.md`.

`check-dev-gates` verifies that the spec, handoff, verify, context, and worklog structure are present and still compact enough to avoid context sprawl.

## Documentation Placement

Create durable project documentation under `DEV/` by default.

If the user asks for a public-facing file outside `DEV/`, such as root `README.md` or product docs, keep the operational context, decision, and maintenance note in `DEV/` as well.

Do not paste long logs, full diffs, dependency dumps, or generated output into `DEV/`. Link to paths and summarize the result.
