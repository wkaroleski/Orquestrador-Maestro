Compact operational documentation and project memory.

Recommended read order:

1. `INDEX.md`
2. `HANDOFF.md`
3. `CONTEXT.md`
4. `SPECS/ACTIVE.md`
5. The task-specific document

Keep `WORKLOG.md` short. Archive older entries with `compact-worklog` instead of turning `WORKLOG.md` into a long transcript.
